        Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. But things become more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person.<br><br>
        <i>Beautifully animated (we're talking Studio Ghibli standards here), Your Name captures that sensation of waking up from a dream you wish lasted longer, or misplacing a name that's still warm on your tongue, but has just departed.

        <p class = "lrg" ><h2>Steins;Gate</h2>
        After discovering time travel, a university student and his colleagues must use their knowledge of it to stop an evil organization and their diabolical plans.<br><br>
        <i>Steins;Gate manages to cover a lot of ground; it can be hilarious at times as well as downright disturbing, simultaneously both emotionally engaging and comically entertaining.

        <p class = "lrg" ><h2>Guards! Guards!</h2></h2>
        Insurrection is in the air in the city of Ankh-Morpork. The Haves and Have-Nots are about to fall out all over again.
        Captain Sam Vimes of the city’s ramshackle Night Watch is used to this. It’s enough to drive a man to drink. Well, to drink more. But this time, something is different – the Have-Nots have found the key to a dormant, lethal weapon that even they don’t fully understand, and they’re about to unleash a campaign of terror on the city.<br><br>
        <i>Pratchett is at the peak of his powers; it's hard to think of any humorist writing in Britain today who can match him...A masterful ear for dialogue, a keen eye for the ridiculous and a real feel for language.
